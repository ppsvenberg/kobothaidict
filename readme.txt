Instructions

This dictionary is using the database from LEXiTRON (http://lexitron.nectec.or.th). It contains about 83,000 definitions.

The new dictionary will replace the English dictionary on the Kobo. If you want to replace a different language dictionary, 
then use the appropriate suffix, e.g., dicthtml-de.zip for German, dicthtml-nl.zip for Dutch.

Procedure
1.Connect Kobo to PC.
2.Open folder .kobo/dict then backup all files in this folder.
3.Rename the new dictionary (dicthtml-th.zip) to the dictionary that you want to replace.
4.Copy the renamed new dictionary to folder .kobo/dict replacing the old one.
5.Disconnect Kobo

You may need to open a book and then flip between dictionaries in order to get your new dictionary's index to be loaded
and recognised by the Kobo (you only need to do this once after replacing the dictionary).
